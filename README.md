# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-NLP
The objective of this project is to design and implement a system that automatically detects whether a given news article is fake or real using machine learning techniques.
The project also includes an interactive Tkinter-based graphical interface for end users and visual representations such as WordClouds to enhance interpretability.
The goal is to create a lightweight yet effective model capable of real-time fake news detection and visualization of patterns in news datasets.
